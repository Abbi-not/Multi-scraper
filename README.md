# 🌍 Multi Job Scraper

A Flask-based job aggregator that scrapes remote job listings from multiple sources and serves them through an API.  
The frontend is a simple Bootstrap-powered UI that lets users browse jobs with infinite scroll (Load More button).

---

## ✨ Features
- Scrapes jobs from:
  - [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/)
  - [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/)
  - [Remotive](https://remotive.com/)
  - [TrulyRemote](https://trulyremote.io/)
- Balanced job distribution across sites (so Remotive doesn’t overwhelm the feed).
- REST API to fetch jobs (`/api/jobs`).
- Bootstrap frontend with responsive job cards.
- Load more button to fetch jobs dynamically.
